# Information Technology Background in Chronological order.

Please note this is a very rough quick draft of all the key important points in my life. There are lots of things that I might have missed or excluded for certain reasons.

## 1997 - My first PC
Intel Pentium 2 - Windows 3.1
Did not have a CD drive installed, was so young and a noob we could not get someone to to install it for me.

## 1999 - The Matrix 
This movie would have a profound impact on my life, even though I did not release this for some time.

## 2000 - My second PC
My parents bought me a Packard Bell Computer which had an Intel Celeron CPU, it come with windows 2000. Upgraded it to Windows ME and the eventually to XP.
They bought it from Makro which is like the South African equivalent of Wallmart. They got ripped off by the sales person as it wasn't the best PC at the time.

## 2001 - A internet odyssey
First contact with the internet. My parent subscribed to MWEB's black box, which was a 56K modem. From then onwards I would begin to explore the world wide web till this day.

## 2002 - Building my first custom PC.
So after outgrowing the power that the Intel Celeron could not provide, I needed something more powerfully to run the latest games at the time. I bought the book "Building a PC for Dummies", this book tought me to overcome my fear of frying PC components and gave me the knowledge I needed to build my first custom PC. It was an intel pentium 4 with an Radon 9600 Pro running windows XP. It also thought me to do research on the latest and greatest PC hardware components.

## 2003 - The Matrix Reloaded and My first hack.
The matrix reloaded released this year and I got my first glimpse of Trinity using Nmap to hack the power station.
Durning this time there were restrictions on the amount of data you could download each month, like 1GB per month. This was not enough to satisfy my data pirate urges.
I needed more data, so I come up with the idea of scanning my Internet Services Providers IP ip range using Angry IP scanner and Nmap to identify routers and they models by their banner.
I used this information and searched for default credentials for each type of router and also made my first common password list to use to manually brute force my way into the router.
Once in the router I would go to the internet settings page and find the username, I would then have to view the source code to find the password as it was using hidden character fields.
This gave me the username and password of their ISP account which I then used at the end of each month to download what I wanted and deplete their remaining bandwidth caps.

## 2004 - My short esports gaming carrier.
I got really good at counter strike 1.6 and source and use to play a lot so much so I joined a clan, competed in regionals and national tournaments at the time.
I also become a gaming server admin on Telkoms gaming servers and was responsible for maintaining order and banning hackers.
I also hacked in games to get a better understanding of how gaming hackers operated and behaved so I could spot them my easier.

## 2005/2006 - Computer Overclocking to the Max
So my custom PC was getting old and I need more FPS, I discovered an easy free way to get more performance from my computer by overclocking it.
My parents would not be me a completely new computer so i needed to do this. It worked for a while and then slowly I would upgrade part by part.
I took this to the extreme and started competing in our local South African online computer forums to try get the highest benchmark scores.
I started using lots of fans, then water cooling and then got my father to make special CPU blocks that I could then use with dry ice and liquid nitrogen.
I set a few world records with my AMD 3200 and AMD 3800 and pair of Nvidia 6600GT graphics cards. This was a really expensive hobby at the time and I did kill a few PC components along the way, RIP AMD 3800 and 6600GT.
This taught me a lot more about computer components.

I also finally got caught for my ISP account router hacking. Some systems administrator was able to track me down and gave my parents a phone call, luckily they explained I was still a young kid and did not really know the consequences of what I was doing.
The sys admin sent a fax stating that my parents compensate the company for losses or R3000 at the time and they would not press criminal charges. 
My parents were not happy with me and told me to stop hacking peoples ISP accounts.

Durning this time me and my cousin create our first websites to host our overclocking content, we create an PHP forum. This year also marks the beginnings of the company web hosting company Elitehost.co.za which started in the fact that we wanted our own web server.
I would help my cousin a bit with this but my interest waned and he would continue to develop this company further into a major player in the Web hosting space in South Africa.

## 2007 - Top IT student
I finish High School with the highest mark in Information Technology at the time and also learnt some delphi programming.
The overclocking and PC building helped me achieve high marks as I had a good understanding of computer hardware.

## 2008 - A bad choice and a good choice
I decided to enrol in Accounting at University following my Big Brothers footsteps in trying to become a Charted Accountant. I learnt some business skills and stats but ultimately it would not be my thing and I did not enjoy it.
The good choice was having a part time job doing computer building and network installation with a friend of my who owned a networking/computer support company. I would also be assigned a post at a high school as a support technician where I helped install their fiber network and helped to maintain and administrate their windows machines for the student IT classes.

## 2009 - A dark year and a space war.
I was still studying accounting but was not enjoying, I was however enjoying Eve Online and participated in one of the biggest internet space ship wars at the time involving a few thousand players. I would ultimately become a fleet commander and tell hundreds of guys of what to do with their internet spaceships in the war of Goonswarm vs band of brothers.

## 2010 - Fitness journey.
I realized I was unhappy and quit accounting and I was also getting fat. So i decided to get into fitness and health, it went well that I decided pursue a Certificates in Exercise Science and Qualified Fitness Professional aka Personal Trainer.

## 2011 - Personal Trainer and Fitness Class Instructor
I worked as a personal trainer and fitness class instructor for almost 2 years. Durring my down time I would browse the reddit technology, science, netsec and hacking subreddits. I would also do java, python, javascript exercises on codecademy.com
As those were always my interests. This job taught me time management and how to interact with all sorts of people increasing my client facing skills a lot.

## 2012 - I enrolled at Monash South Africa University in a Bachelors in Computer and Information Sciences.
I knew that I.T was my passion so I decided to pursue it. I started getting heavily into programming and then started hacking again for the first time in a while.
I started first by rooting my andriod phone and installing dSploit, a man in the middle framework for a cell phone. This allowed me to do man in the middle attacks and do fun things like replacing all images in peoples browsers with pictures of cows.
I use to sit in the back of the class/lecture hall and watch peoples reactions and try not to laugh.
It then went from that to Wifi hacking, where I bought my first promiscuous capable wifi adaptor, which allowed me to snif wireless traffic using wireshark find facebook and other login details, conduct HTTPS downgrade attacks, DNS Highjacking, ARP spoofing, so I could be the man in the middle and see and manipulate their data.
This was the time before HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) release in 2016. I did dabble with SSL strip at the time also.

During my time at University I start receiving letters of acknowledgement from Monash stating that I have achieve the highest marks for varying subjects including Networking and IT Security.

## 2015 - First Industrial Work Experience and Graduation.
In our last year of studies we are required to interact with a real client and build them a custom software solution. I am appointed Team Lead, Project Manager and also end up being lead architect and lead developer for my teams project.
We are assigned a big client Dimension Data/Internet Solutions and are required to build a custom Java Enterprise web/mobile/hybrid application that manages the schedules and rosters of all their field engineers and how they interact with the call centers.
We deliver the project successfully, the client is very happy and we achieve the highest grade for this industrial experience project subject. 
The project also taught me how to secure data at rest, encrypt passwords with strong hashes and salts in the DB and how to avoid SQL injection attacks and how to apply authentication and authorization mechanisms.
The stack project stack was Linux + Java Enterprise Edition + Glassfish Web Application Server + MySQL

I finish my degree top of the class achieving the highest overall average marks. Summa cum laude and Valor Victorian and I am asked to present a speech at my graduation ceremony.

## 2016 - Honours Research
I attempted to gain my honours degree but was not successful due to various reason. I did pass all my course subjects including advanced research methodologies but failed to get my thesis fully approved and completed.
My supervisor was not invested in any of his students and all of them under his supervisory failed.
My research into Wireless Mesh networks and protocols and how it could bridge the digital divide was to complicated for any one in my University as my network lecturer had left the year before.
The scope was also very massive and I tried to do and achieve to much. 

During this year I also founded my Universities first Information Technology Club called Monash IT Society (MITS). I create a customized WordPress website www.mitsociety.com , secure it and I also integrated a PHP based forum system.
I organized LAN party events and even hosted a Hackthon event, but could not participate as it would be unfair to the competitors.

## 2017 / 2018 - A professional software engineer / developer / coder / programmer is born
I had a choice to either join SensePost now part of Orange Cyber Defence as a junior ethical hacker or join the best software development company in South Africa.
I decided to join the software development company called Entelect, as they seemed like a really great company, a bunch of my University friends were already working there and I had come to the conclusion that I should adopt the philosophy of learning how to make software systems properly before I break them. I also knew that if I had started as an ethical hacker straight away I would never revert back to becoming a software engineer/developer.
We start at Entelect with a vigorous 3 month bootcamp training course that teaches us how to create 3 different projects with 2 different software stacks. 
* Java Spring + MySQL + Bootstrap Frontend
* .Net Framework Web API + MSSQL + Angular and Bootstrap Frontend

After the bootcamp I am assigned to a banking/financial sector client and I am tasked with re-engineering their backend systems from a monolithic design to a micro-service API architecture and move it into the Microsoft Azure cloud.
Durning this time I learn a lot of how financial institutions secure their systems, what types of security mechanisms and practices the implement and require.
Whenever a security related task came up I always volunteered to be part of it.
* I created the overall system logging framework using Application Insights in Azure. 
* I implemented IPv4 and IPv6 tracking and blocking of systems to not allow unauthorized IP addresses from accessing internal systems.
* I helped with the Authentication JWT mechanisms.
* I implemented the encryption algorithms that would secure our passwords within our code bases.
* I created with the help of my team lead the Dev Ops automated powershell build scripts to be used with Jenkins.
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

## 2019 - Cloud Systems Administrator
I a web hosting cloud provider company called Elitehost.co.za
I had helped to found this company in 2005 with my cousin and he needed my help to grow it further. I would also bring in my qualified educated IT background knowledge and help them develop properly their internal PHP systems to help manage all their servers.
During this time I learnt a lot about the Domain Name System and DNS records and what each one does. I also learnt about linux server administration, IPtables, firewall rules and Web Application Firewalls. 
I would also learn a lot about Data Center networking in general. I also created a whole bunch of internal training content for a lot of technical related stuff in their confluence that I helped to create and manage.
I also responded to security incidents where peoples websites would get hacked. I advised clients as to wha the hacks were and how they could fix the loop holes and recover their websites. Normally it was outdated software like wordpress and insecure folder permissions and a whole bunch of other wrong security settings. I also learned a lot about email server and how they operate and the fight against spam and DDoS attacks..
I would also help to fight email spoofing scams by researching and implementing counter measures that would save the company's clients many hours of worrying frustration.
I developed a PHP Knowledge base system that would use the Conflunce API and WHM create client facing Knowledge base articles to help them with various things.

I eventually left the company as they had made certain promises they did not keep and the one partner was unethical in his behavior and probably felt threatened by me. Plus family and work relationships get complicated.

## 2020 - A real official hacker is born
I finally decide to pursue my life long dream and I enrol in one of the best starting hacking certifications to get. The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), this would be one of the hardest things I tried to get. It would also mark the first time ever I failed an exam. I achieved 60 points in my first attempt, which was super close, only 10 points short of a pass, 50 points in my second attempt and finally 85 points in the 3rd attempt. I never gave up and it taught me to indeed try harder.
During this year of full time study, I went from hacking a handful of computer systems to hacking hundreds of systems, I learnt so much and enjoyed the process and I know that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life until I retire.
